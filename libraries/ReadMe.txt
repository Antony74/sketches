Each library is used by one or more of the sketches here.  Obviously if you
already have the libraries then these instructions can be disregarded.

In order to be able to build and run these sketches you will need to copy
these two directories into the relevant sub-directory of your Processing
install.  e.g. processing-2.0b7/modes/java/libraries

Geomerative (rev 37) was downloaded from
http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/

Rhino 1.7R4 (in the folder "js") was downloaded from
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino

To make additional use of these libraries, getting the full download is
strongly recommended, as only the bare minimum of library files have been
included here.
